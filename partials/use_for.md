Use this guidance for writing qualitative research articles. It is a general guideline that can be used to describe research that involves any qualitative methods, any kind of qualitative data, and uses any kind of approach, epistemology, or ontology.

<!-- [#TODO: All ontologies and epistemologies?]{.todo} -->
You can also use this guideline for:

* writing protocols (use the items within the Introduction and Method sections).
* reviewing the _reporting_ of an article, but not for appraising its quality.
