Use this guidance for writing qualitative research articles. It is a general guideline applicable to all qualitative methods, data, epistemologies and ontologies.

<!-- [#TODO: All ontologies and epistemologies?]{.todo} -->
You can also use this guideline for:

* writing protocols (use the items within the Introduction and Method sections).
* reviewing the _reporting_ of an article, but not for appraising its quality.
