[_"Reporting guidelines help me structure my drafts and develop as a researcher. I use them when teaching and hope that my students continue to use them."<br><br>_ Manuel Silva - Researcher]{.aside}

This reporting guideline does not prescribe a rigid format or standardized content. Consider each item and prioritize elements that are most relevant to your study, findings, context, and readers.

You may prefer to report an item in a different order, section, or in a table or figure. If you feel confident that an item is less important to your study, you could report it in an appendix or supplement. If you think an item is not applicable, state why. You don't need to write your article in the order the items are presented. Many researchers prefer to write the methods section first.

In your methods section, state that you used the SRQR guideline when writing your article and cite it (see [How to cite](#citation)).
