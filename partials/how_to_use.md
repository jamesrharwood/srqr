This reporting guideline does not prescribe a rigid format or standardized content.

Consider each item and prioritize elements that are most relevant to your study, findings, context, and readership.

You may prefer to report an item in a different order, section, or in a table or figure. If you feel confident that an item is less important to your study, you could report it in an appendix or supplement.

You don't need to write your article in the order the items are presented. Many researchers prefer to write the methods section first.
