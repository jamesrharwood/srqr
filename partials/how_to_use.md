This reporting guideline is best used early:

    * Use a template to write quickly and avoid the blank page
    * Use a checklist to double-check and reassure others that your work is described transparently

You don't need to write your article in the order the items are presented. For instance, some people prefer to write the methods section first.

The guideline does not prescribe a rigid format or standardized content. Consider each item and prioritize elements that are most relevant to your study, findings, context, and readership. The guideline order is just a suggestion, you may prefer to report an item in a different place, section, or in a table or figure. If you feel confident that an item is less important to your study, you could report it in an appendix or supplement, but remember these are harder for readers to find, not peer reviewed, and not indexed by search engines.
