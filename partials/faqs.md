### Does SRQR prescribe structure?

No. This reporting guideline does not prescribe a rigid format or standardized content. Consider each item and prioritize elements that are most relevant to your study, findings, context, and readers.

You may prefer to report an item in a different order, section, or in a table or figure. If you feel confident that an item is less important to your study, you could report it in an appendix or supplement. If you think an item is not applicable, state why. You don't need to write your article in the order the items are presented.

### What to do if asked to remove guideline related content

If a colleague or reviewer asks you to remove content that is related to this guideline, you can direct them to this guideline and the explanation for why that item is important. If they insist, consider moving the item to a supplement, table or figure.
