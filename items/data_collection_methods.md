Qualitative research encompasses an array of data collection methods appropriate for various paradigms and approaches, including (but not limited to) interviews, focus groups, observations (direct or indirect via video), and review of written text, photographs, and other documents or materials. Researchers may choose to use information from multiple sources, contexts, and/or time points depending on their approach and research question(s). (See Item 11 for triangulation.) Given this diversity of methods, authors should describe in detail their data collection design and method(s) and justify them in relation to the research question(s), paradigm, approach, and other methods. Methods used to decide when to end data collection should also be described (see Item 8).

Qualitative research often occurs as an iterative process, meaning that researchers begin data analysis before they complete data collection. The data collection and analysis process may occur in phases or stages, and thus authors must clearly describe the iterative process of data collection and analysis. As part of an iterative collection-analysis process, researchers will often alter their data collection methods to explore their preliminary impressions in greater depth and/or actively pursue confirming and disconfirming perspectives. If such changes occur during the research process, authors should describe how and why study procedures changed in response to evolving study findings.

The study period (start and end dates for data collection and analysis) should be identified so that readers can place the study in temporal context and identify factors not mentioned by the authors that might affect findings, interpretation, and implications. (See Item 8 for ending data collection.)

Authors should describe important characteristics of the individuals conducting interviews, observations or focus groups, and methods used to train these individuals. This information clarifies the relationship between the individuals involved in data collection and the participants in the research and also explains what efforts were made to ensure consistency in the data collection process (See Items 6 and 15.)

## Examples

> Further, it was decided that group interviews, also known as focus group discussions would be the best means of data collection. This is a method of data collection that enables group members to feed off each other's ideas and an effective moderator will maintain group focus whilst at the same time permitting flexibility in the direction those aspects of the discussion might take. [REF]

> Adjustments to the interview protocol were made according to early experience and information participants had provided (i.e. redundant questions were eliminated; questions were reworded to improve flow and clarity; additional probes were included).

> Faculty staff were then interviewed individually by a trained study investigator in a 15-minute, semi-structured interview. This sequence was repeated with other video encounters. Table 2 presents examples of interview questions. Each faculty member was interviewed by at least three interviewers over their various interviews. Interviewers were chosen based on their experience in interviewing. All were trained during a half-day meeting to interpret and deliver the interview guide in the same manner in order to elicit information of a consistent type.
