title: Researcher characteristics and reflexivity
---
Researchers’ characteristics that may influence the research, including personal attributes, qualifications/experience, relationship with participants, assumptions, and/or presuppositions; potential or actual interaction between researchers’ characteristics and the research questions, approach, methods, results and/or transferability.

Reflexivity refers to intentional, systematic consideration of the potential or actual effects of the researcher(s) on all aspects of the study process. In positivist and post-positivist paradigms, personal characteristics and perspectives of researchers might be viewed as biases that limit the credibility of study findings, while in constructivist or interpretivist paradigms the characteristics and perspectives of the researchers are important contextual factors that are an accepted part of the study design, data collection, and data analysis. These characteristics and perspectives may explain how the researcher(s) obtained access to the site or participants included in the study or may add valuable insight during data analysis.

To demonstrate reflexivity, authors should describe important personal characteristics and perspectives of members of the research team that may influence design, data collection, and data analysis. Relevant personal characteristics might include cultural background, occupation, experience, training, position/ power dynamics, gender, race/ethnicity, and sponsoring institution. Authors should also describe the perspectives, assumptions, prior knowledge, preliminary hypotheses, and/or motives (the "stance") of the members of the research team.

Authors also should describe the researchers’ relationships to participants in the study and what decisions were made in light of these relationships.  For example, were any members of the research team part of the sample of potential participants in the study? Do any members of the team teach, supervise, or have any authority over participants in the study? If so, how do these characteristics influence choices about their roles in data collection and analysis? For observational research (e.g., ethnography), it is also important to identify the role of the researcher along a spectrum from passive observer (no involvement in the activity studied) to participant-observer (ranging from some limited involvement in the activity to full involvement).

There is no expectation that the study could be precisely replicated; these characteristics and perspectives of the researcher should not be mentioned in the limitation section. (See also Item 14.)

## Examples

> Reflexivity was maintained by the research team through the analysis and writing by recording, discussing and challenging established assumptions. In addition both EH and SV kept reflexive diaries.

> The first author conducted all interviews and discussion groups. Her own medical undergraduate training took place between 1995 and 2000. She was not known to the participants of this research prior to undertaking the study and deliberately did not undertake any clinical or teaching activities locally alongside this research. Whilst it was useful to ‘know’ (from her own background) what the students were talking about medically (and in terms of detecting items of significance), as a researcher she made conscious efforts not to accept potentially common assumptions at face value.
