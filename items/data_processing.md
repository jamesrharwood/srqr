Item 13. Data processing: Methods for processing data prior to and during analysis, including transcription, data entry, data management and security, verification of data integrity, data coding and anonymization / de-identification of excerpts.
Explanation:
Authors should describe the ways in which data are prepared for analysis and managed throughout the analysis process. These activities might include transcription, coding, data entry, and organization of data. When processing audio or video recordings, relevant details might include indication of verbatim transcription of dialogue, additional notes to capture non- verbal information (especially for group interviews or focus groups), and annotations to indicate vocal inflections and utterances, as appropriate for the analytic approach. Authors should also describe procedures used to check transcripts for accuracy.
Authors should describe the processes used to organize, compile, and categorize data (e.g., field notes, transcripts, documents, photographs, artifacts) for analysis.
Authors should describe procedures used to maintain data security and protect the privacy of participants, as specified in the human subjects protocols. For example, if data are anonymized, the authors should explain how and at what point in the process this occurred. Authors may choose to use anonymous labels or identifiers to represent quotes or excerpts from unique participants, documents or events, in order to reflect the variety of sources from which such data were derived.
Examples:
Interviews were anonymised and each participant was given a code number.
The interviewers and another member of the research team (H.B.) reviewed transcripts for accuracy.
We collected data throughout the admission process through direct observation, audio- recording, and chart extraction. We audio-recorded, transcribed, and anonymized both the overnight and morning case review discussions. We also observed the morning case review discussions in person and collected field notes. For each case review discussion, we copied the admission notes from the patientâ€™s record and de-identified all data.
