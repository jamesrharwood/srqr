## Example

> We conducted the study among hospital-based clinical teachers of students in years 4 to 6 of a six-year undergraduate medical program at Maastricht University Medical School. Years 4 to 6 are devoted to clerkships in the academic hospital and affiliated regional hospitals. Rotations differ in duration depending on the type of rotation and the discipline, and the sequence of rotations differs among students. During rotations, students spend time in the wards, the outpatient clinics, and the accident and emergency department. Clerkships in years 4 and 5 last between 4 and 10 weeks (“regular clerkship”), whereas students in year 6 undertake an 18-week “senior clerkship” in a discipline of their choice.
