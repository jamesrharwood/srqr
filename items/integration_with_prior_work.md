## Examples

> This study contributes to the understanding and discussion of the complexity of involving patients in healthcare education. It shows that integrating patient-led teaching into initiatives that are partly faculty-led influences the way in which students perceive learning from and with PIs. What is not known, however, is whether perceptions are also affected by type of health profession and the studentsâ€™ different orientation towards logics of care and science, and issues of authority and power relations.
