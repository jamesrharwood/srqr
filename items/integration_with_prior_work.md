title: Integration with prior work, implications, transferability, and contribution(s) to the field
---
**Short summary of main findings, explanation of how findings and conclusions connect to, support, elaborate on, or challenge conclusions of earlier scholarship; discussion of scope of application/generalizability; identification of unique contribution(s) to scholarship in a discipline or field.**

The authors should begin the Discussion with a short summary of the main findings. The short summary reminds readers of the main findings and may help them assess whether the subsequent interpretation and implications formulated by the authors are supported by the findings.

The authors’ description of their findings or results should include some interpretation of the data in the context of previous findings, experiences, theory, or a guiding paradigm or approach. The discussion provides authors an opportunity to elaborate on their findings in relation to their research question(s) and study purpose(s); connect their findings to prior empirical work, theories, and/or frameworks; and discuss implications. The authors should explicitly describe how their findings contribute to or advance the field. Implications may include transferability, or specifying the appropriate scope for generalization of the findings beyond the study (e.g., to other settings, populations, time periods, circumstances).

## Why this information is important


## Examples

> This study contributes to the understanding and discussion of the complexity of involving patients in healthcare education. It shows that integrating patient-led teaching into initiatives that are partly faculty-led influences the way in which students perceive learning from and with PIs. What is not known, however, is whether perceptions are also affected by type of health profession and the students’ different orientation towards logics of care and science, and issues of authority and power relations.
