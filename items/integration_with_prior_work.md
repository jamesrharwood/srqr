title: Integration with prior work, implications, transferability, and contribution(s) to the field
checklist: Summarize the main findings, explain how findings and conclusions connect to, support, elaborate on, or challenge conclusions of earlier scholarship; discuss the scope of application/generalizability; identify unique contribution(s) to scholarship in a discipline or field.
---

## What to write

Describe how the findings and conclusions connect to, support, elaborate on, or challenge previous findings, experiences, theory, or a guiding paradigm or approach.

Describe how the findings contribute to or advance the field.

Describe any implications of the work, such transferability or generalizability.
<!-- #ASK transferability vs generalizability? -->

This item can be reported in the Results or Discussion sections (see [note](#where-to-report)).

## Why readers need this information

The short summary reminds readers of the main findings and may help them assess whether the subsequent interpretation and implications formulated by the authors are supported by the findings.

The discussion provides you an opportunity to elaborate on your findings in relation to your research question(s) and study purpose(s); connect your findings to prior empirical work, theories, and/or frameworks; and discuss implications.

## Where to report this item {#where-to-report}

In qualitative research the distinction between results and discussion tends to blur because analysis often involves interpretation, inference, and synthesis. Although most journals require separate sections for Results and Discussion, many elements of Items 16–19 could reasonably be reported in either section. As such, we defer to authors and editors to determine where to report these essential elements.

## Examples

> This study contributes to the understanding and discussion of the complexity of involving patients in healthcare education. It shows that integrating patient-led teaching into initiatives that are partly faculty-led influences the way in which students perceive learning from and with PIs. What is not known, however, is whether perceptions are also affected by type of health profession and the students’ different orientation towards logics of care and science, and issues of authority and power relations.
