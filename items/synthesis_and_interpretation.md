title: Synthesis and interpretation
---
**Main findings (e.g., interpretations, inferences, and themes); might include development of a theory or model, or integration with prior research or theory.**

In qualitative research the distinction between results and discussion tends to blur because analysis often involves interpretation, inference, and synthesis. Although most journals require separate sections for Results and Discussion, many elements of Items 16-19 could reasonably be reported in either section. As such, we defer to authors and editors to determine where to report these essential elements.

Authors should identify the main analytic findings (e.g., interpretations, inferences, narratives, themes, models). The nature of these findings and how they are reported will depend on the approach and methodology selected and thus should be in alignment with the approach and methods.

In most cases, the authors should report a synthesis of their data along with specific quotes, examples, or illustrations derived from their data. Authors might also report frequency, variety, representativeness, counter-examples, concrete details, contextualization, conditions, and qualifications related to their findings. Frequency counts (e.g., the frequency of specific themes or codes) play a limited role in qualitative research, and need not be reported unless they play a meaningful role in interpretation of the data.

Findings might also include integration with prior literature or theory and/or the development of a theory, model or meta-narrative. Judicious use of tables and figures can help communicate such findings.

## Examples

> We identified four patterns of NVB (non-verbal behavior) that relate to handover quality and have dubbed them: (1) joint focus of attention; (2) ‘the poker hand’; (3) parallel play; and (4) kerbside consultation. Each pattern constitutes a ‘transfix,’ or systematic way of participating non-verbally in the care transfer process. And, although there are variations in each pattern, we have been able to code virtually every handover we have observed in nursing, medicine and surgery into one of these four categories.

> Because our participants came from similar educational backgrounds, had studied medicine as their tertiary course, were embedded in the culture of medicine, and were associated in meaningful ways with a single medical school, we approached their transcripts with the assumption that they belonged to a loosely formed discourse community. Although their graduation dates ranged over a period of 50 years and their collective sphere of practice included 10 different specialty areas, there were many similarities in their experiences of enculturation during and after medical school.

> Their three major (often overlapping) areas of concern were epistemic (acquiring knowledge and skill), interpersonal (relating to patients, families, colleagues and administrators) and personal (achieving work–life balance). In each of these areas, medical enculturation was achieved by two overlapping processes, ‘absorption’ and ‘assimilation’, each of which may have distinct implications for postgraduate medical education.
