title: Problem Formulation
---
**Description and significance of the problem/phenomenon studied; review of relevant theory and empirical work; problem statement.**

The problem formulation typically appears in the introduction and describes the theoretical and/or practical issues or concerns that make the study necessary. It should provide an overview of what is known about the problem, highlight gaps in current knowledge (the problem statement), and define the scope of the research problem or phenomena addressed in the study (what will and will not be included). It should include a review of theoretical and/or empirical work directly relevant to the problem or phenomena studied. The problem formulation should be described in a way that suggests the need for a qualitative approach (e.g., to elucidate poorly defined or previously unexplored constructs, to generate theories or to develop causal explanations connecting processes and outcomes, to understand phenomena as they naturally occur and the role of context, to explore problems involving high complexity, to gain insight into participants’ perspectives when such insight is lacking).

## Example

> Regulatory focus theory may therefore offer insight into the variability in responses to feedback, but how well do these experimental findings translate to real clinical situations in which the reality of responsiveness to feedback seems frustratingly complex? .... In order to better elaborate a theory to account for this variability in learner response to feedback, the present study was undertaken. We aimed, in this study, to determine how readily clinical learning events could be classified as activating a promotion or a prevention focus, and to explore, through a careful analysis of doctors’ descriptions of their feedback experiences, the predictive value of regulatory focus theory in the context of real clinical learning situations.
