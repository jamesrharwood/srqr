For events, this might include the location, date(s), length, characteristics of attendees or participants in the event, or mood or emotional climate.]

Include the dates or timeframe for participation.

If the _actual_ sample differs from the target sample, describe:

* the difference,
* why these differences may have occurred,
* how this might affect the findings.

If the degree of participation varied among individuals, describe:

* the different levels of participation,
* the reasons for these differences (i.e., the researchers’ choice or the participants’ preferences),
* and how these different levels of participation were taken into account in the analysis.

This information could appear in the Methods section as part of the description of the sample, or at the beginning of the Results section to provide context for the findings presented.

## Example

> Of the 70 Mindful Communication program participants, 46 met the eligibility requirements to participate in the in-depth interviews. We randomly chose and then contacted 22 participants, of whom 20 agreed to be interviewed within six months of completing the program: 15 in person and 5 by telephone. Two declined for lack of time. On reaching saturation after 20 interviews, no further attempts to contact the remaining 24 participants were made.
>
> There were 31 nursing handovers covering 137 patients, and 21 resident handovers covering 101 patients included in this study.
