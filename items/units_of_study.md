Describe the number of participants, documents, or events included in the study (the units of study).

Describe characteristics of the participants, documents or events that are relevant to the study purpose and research question(s).(See _Read more_ for examples of relevant characteristics.)

Include the dates or timeframe for participation.

If the _actual_ sample differs from the target sample, describe:

* the difference,
* why these differences may have occurred,
* how this might affect the findings.

If the degree of participation varied among individuals, describe:

* the different levels of participation,
* the reasons for these differences (i.e., the researchers’ choice or the participants’ preferences),
* and how these different levels of participation were taken into account in the analysis.

This information could appear in the Methods section as part of the description of the sample, or at the beginning of the Results section to provide context for the findings presented.

## How does this item differ to Sampling (Item 8)?

The sampling item (Item 8) describes the target or ideal participants, documents, or events selected for the study. By contrast, this item focuses on description of the actual participants, documents or events included in the study.

## Relevant characteristics

For participants, characteristics might include age, gender, profession, institution, year of training, or relationship to the researcher and/or other participants in the study. For documents, this might include the source, intended audience, date, or type of document.

For events, this might include the location, date(s), length, characteristics of attendees or participants in the event, or mood or emotional climate.

## Example

> Of the 70 Mindful Communication program participants, 46 met the eligibility requirements to participate in the in-depth interviews. We randomly chose and then contacted 22 participants, of whom 20 agreed to be interviewed within six months of completing the program: 15 in person and 5 by telephone. Two declined for lack of time. On reaching saturation after 20 interviews, no further attempts to contact the remaining 24 participants were made.
>
> There were 31 nursing handovers covering 137 patients, and 21 resident handovers covering 101 patients included in this study.
