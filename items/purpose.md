        What was the purpose of your study? Authors often frame this as one or more questions or statements, often asking "how" or "why". 

        Consider the acronym [SPIDER](https://doi.org/10.1177/1049732312452938): 
        
        * Sample (who did you speak to?), 
        * Phenomena of Interest (the topic of the research, e.g., the behaviour or event you are interested in) 
        * Design (your theoretical framework and methods)
        * Evaluation (the outcomes of your study e.g., experiences, attitudes, barriers)
        * Research type (e.g., qualitative, mixed-methods, case study, phenomenology, grounded theory)

        NB. You'll notice this guide asks questions in a different order to how articles are presented. There are more questions about your introduction later, and questions about your abstract and title appear later still. This is because we recommend beginning to write by first defining your research question, then describing your methods and results.

## What to write

["A clear purpose frames the article." [Rahilah Zayn - Researcher]{.attribution}]{.aside}

Include a statement of study intent. This can be framed as one or more research questions(see [note](#qualitative-questions)), purposes, goals, or objectives.

## Why readers need this information

By clearly stating the purpose of the study, authors set readers’ expectations for the methods, findings and discussion sections of the manuscript.

## Qualitative research questions {#qualitative-questions}

Qualitative studies often explore “how” and “why” questions related to a social or human problems or phenomenon, and they are designed to enhance readers’ understanding of a problem or phenomenon.

## Example

> The purposes of this study were to investigate how medical students recognize, respond to and utilise feedback, and to determine whether there are maturational differences in understandings of the role of feedback across academic years in medical school.

## Training and Resources

See [this article](https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000001438) for advice on writing qualitative research questions.
