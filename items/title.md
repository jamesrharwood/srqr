**Concise description of the nature and topic of the study. Identifying the study as qualitative or indicating the approach (e.g., ethnography, grounded theory) or data collection methods (e.g., interview, focus group) is recommended.**

The authors should provide a title that clearly conveys the topic of the study. We suggest that the title indicate that the study is qualitative or include a commonly used term that identifies the approach (e.g., ethnographic study, grounded theory) or data collection methods (e.g., interviews, focus groups, observations). This allows readers and reviewers to quickly identify the type of study.

## Examples

> Residents learning from a narrative experience with dying patients: a qualitative study.

> Medical students' perceptions of the factors influencing their academic performance: an exploratory interview study with high-achieving and re-sitting medical students.

> Undergraduate rural medical education program development: focus group consultation with the NRHA Rural Medical Educators Group.
