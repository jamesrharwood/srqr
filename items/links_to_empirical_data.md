    text: |
        For your bullet points above, go through your data and select quotes/excerpts that you feel best exemplify your findings.

        Depending on your target journal, your word limit may restrict the number of quotes you can include, so consider sharing evidence in a supplement or repository.

        Remember to include evidence that show variety, disagreement, or nuance.

## What to write

Provide evidence (e.g., quotes, field notes, text excerpts, photographs) to substantiate the more general and abstract concepts or inferences they present as findings (see [note](#de-identifying-evidence) on de-identification). ["I love seeing evidence like this because it really brings results to life." [Nkinda Akaro - Researcher]{.attribution}]{.aside}

You could report this evidence in a table or figure, incorporated into a narrative description of findings, as a stand-alone narrative, or in text blocks embedded in the manuscript text. If you are constrained by word limits or media limitations (e.g., video), consider sharing data via  an appendix, supplemental material, or web-based repository.

This item can be reported in the Results or Discussion sections (see [note](#where-to-report)).

## Why readers need this information

This information helps bring results to life, and adds credibility.
<!-- #ASK Doesn't really reflect necessity -->

## De-identifying evidence {#de-identifying-evidence}

Evidence is typically de-identified to protect the privacy of study participants, settings, and/or institutions. See [Item 14](data-processing.qmd) for reporting anonymisation.

## Where to report this item {#where-to-report}

In qualitative research the distinction between results and discussion tends to blur because analysis often involves interpretation, inference, and synthesis. Although most journals require separate sections for Results and Discussion, many elements of Items 16–19 could reasonably be reported in either section. As such, we defer to authors and editors to determine where to report these essential elements.

## Examples

See Frankel et al. for an excellent example of how to use photographs (or snapshots from video) to illustrate and provide supporting evidence for patterns of behavior identified in the analysis.

> We identified five interruption types: (1) probing for further data, (2) prompting for expected sequence, (3) teaching around the case, (4) thinking out loud, and (5) providing direction (see Table 1). Several interruption types served both goals of the case review discussions—teaching and patient care. For example, when thinking out loud, supervisors reasoned through problems and taught the team: “So that’s the big question, did she have a mechanical fall, or did she have a medicine-related fall?” (Case 2). Supervisors prompted for expected sequence, preventing presenters from skipping over information while simultaneously allowing the supervisor to instruct the team on presentation style: “So now you can tell me what the rest of his test results are because I haven’t heard those” (Case 16).
