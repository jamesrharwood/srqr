**Evidence (e.g., quotes, field notes, text excerpts, photographs) to substantiate analytic findings.**

The authors should provide evidence (e.g., quotes, field notes, text excerpts, photographs) to substantiate the more general and abstract concepts or inferences they present as findings. Such evidence is typically de-identified to protect the privacy of study participants, settings, and/or institutions. The evidence may be presented in a variety of ways such as in a table or figure, incorporated into a narrative description of findings, as a stand-alone narrative, or in text blocks embedded in the manuscript text. If word limits or media limitations (e.g.. video) limit the authors’ ability to provide sufficient representation of supporting data, an appendix, supplemental material, or web-based repository could be used to provide access to additional data.

## Why this information is important

## Examples

See Frankel et al. for an excellent example of how to use photographs (or snapshots from video) to illustrate and provide supporting evidence for patterns of behavior identified in the analysis.

> We identified five interruption types: (1) probing for further data, (2) prompting for expected sequence, (3) teaching around the case, (4) thinking out loud, and (5) providing direction (see Table 1). Several interruption types served both goals of the case review discussions—teaching and patient care. For example, when thinking out loud, supervisors reasoned through problems and taught the team: “So that’s the big question, did she have a mechanical fall, or did she have a medicine-related fall?” (Case 2). Supervisors prompted for expected sequence, preventing presenters from skipping over information while simultaneously allowing the supervisor to instruct the team on presentation style: “So now you can tell me what the rest of his test results are because I haven’t heard those” (Case 16).
