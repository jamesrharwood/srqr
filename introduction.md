# When to use this guidance

::: {.callout-tip icon=false appearance="simple"}
Use this guidance for reporting qualitative research studies.

The SRQR items reflect information essential for inclusion in a qualitative research report, but should not be viewed as prescribing a rigid format or standardized content. Consider each item and prioritize elements that are most relevant to your study, findings, context, and readership.

You can also use this guideline for:

* for writing protocols (use the items within the Introduction and Method sections).
* reviewing the _reporting_ of an article, but not for appraising its quality.
